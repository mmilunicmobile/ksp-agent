# KRPC Smart Autopilot

KRPC Smart Autopilot is a bot that using Poliastro and KRPC and simulation can plan very precise maneuvers in KSP using simulation optimization and then execute them in KSP.

At the moment the physics simulation can simulate simple launch trajectories through an atmosphere to apoapsis. This simulation includes a high quality approximation of drag, thrust, and mass changes.
